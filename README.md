# Nepali Events for Google Calendar and Calendar apps
Plenty of online Nepali Calendars are available presently but there is a gap between making those events available
to the popular calendar applications like Google Calendar and Calendar app on mac. Google Calendar and Calendar on mac have a nice
way to sync the 3rd party calendar events. This project is to provide a Internet Calendaring api for major events
in Nepal.

The Events provided through this api is based on data from [HamroPatro](https://www.hamropatro.com/)
